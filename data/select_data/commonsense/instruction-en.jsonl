This process is similar to the one in animals, and it involves various enzymatic reactions.\n\nIn plants, cellular respiration usually occurs in the mitochondria, and the process can be divided into three stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain.\n\nDuring glycolysis, a molecule of glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. This process takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell and produces two molecules of ATP and two of NADH, a molecule that carries electrons.\n\nThe next stage, the citric acid cycle, takes place inside the mitochondria. Here, the two pyruvate molecules produced in glycolysis are further broken down to produce ATP, NADH, and FADH2, another molecule that carries electrons.\n\nFinally, in the electron transport chain, the NADH and FADH2 molecules produced in the previous stages carry electrons to a series of protein complexes embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. These electrons produce a flow of protons across the membrane, creating a gradient that drives the production of ATP through a process known as chemiosmosis.\n\nIn summary, cellular respiration in plants is a process that involves the breakdown of glucose to produce ATP, which is used as the primary energy source by cells. This process occurs in the mitochondria and involves several stages including glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain."}
